   cd FundTheWorld
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh

### Express & MySQL Configuration

1. **Configure MySQL in `express/utils/db.js`:**

   ```javascript
   const mysql = require('mysql');
   
   const connection = mysql.createConnection({
       host: 'localhost',
       user: 'root',
       password: '123456',
       database: 'demow'
   });
   
   module.exports = connection;
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend directory and start the server:**

   ```sh
   cd Backend
   node app.js
   ```

3. **Verify connection:** Open a browser and navigate to:

   ```arduino
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

   You should see "Successfully connected".

### GraphQL & React Setup

   ```

   Or start them individually:

   - **GraphQL:** `npm run start-graphql`
   - **React:** `npm run start-react`

### Generate Wallet

1. **Install Geth** https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads
2. **Open a terminal and create a wallet for the testnet:**

```sh

```

Save the wallet address and passphrase for future reference.

3. **Fund your wallet:** Go to [Alchemy's Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia), enter your wallet address, confirm *Iâ€™m not a robot*, and click *Send Me ETH*.

4. **Verify the transaction:** After sending ETH, follow the Etherscan transaction link to verify the transaction.

### Connect Wallet to MetaMask
